// Pending inline review comments — PR-style feedback the user leaves on a
// diff/file, batched and then sent into an agent's PTY in one message
// (GH issue #28). Kept in its own transient store (like ui.ts) so adding a
// comment doesn't churn the task tree, and so the data survives tab
// switches (a DiffPane unmounts its CodeMirror view when you leave the tab,
// but the comments must persist until sent).
//
// A comment is anchored to a file path + a 1-based line range, plus the
// quoted source text at that range. The quote is what makes this robust:
// if the agent has since edited the file, line numbers drift but the quoted
// snippet stays greppable, so the agent can still locate the spot.
