// a cached listing, has a read in flight, or is marked failed. Break it and
// the row renders "Loading…" forever with nothing left to fill it, which is
// exactly the bug #159 describes.
//
// These live outside the component so the invariant is unit-testable: there is
// no repro for #159, so the fix has to be argued from the state machine.
