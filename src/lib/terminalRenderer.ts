/** Load the renderer named by the `terminalRenderer` pref onto `term`.
 *  Returns a disposable: call `dispose()` BEFORE `term.dispose()` so the
 *  render loop can't fire on a half-disposed terminal. On "dom", or if the
 *  addon throws (unsupported), nothing is loaded and xterm's built-in DOM
 *  renderer remains. Read once at mount; changing the pref takes effect on
 *  the next terminal spawn (relaunch to switch every open terminal).
 *
 *  GH #140 reported the macOS 26 WebGL surface costing ~33pp of WindowServer
 *  while idle and asked for a way off it. Re-measuring on an M1 Max at a
 *  comparable canvas size (~3.4M device px) did not reproduce that: WebGL
 *  costs ~1pp more WindowServer than DOM, and DOM's total is actually WORSE
 *  once WebContent and WebKit's GPU process are counted, which the issue did
 *  not measure. Under sustained output WebGL is ~2.7x cheaper than either
 *  alternative. So WebGL stays the default and this pref is a compatibility
 *  escape hatch (software rasterizers on Linux/WebKitGTK, driver bugs), NOT a
 *  battery lever. Canvas is the one option that genuinely lowers idle cost,
 *  and it pays for that under load.
 *
 *  The cost also does NOT stack per surface, which the earlier "~10pp per
 *  idle visible terminal" note here got wrong in kind rather than in degree.
 *  Ten split terminals cost +0.8pp of WindowServer and +0.2pp of GPU over
 *  one (n=2 each, same maximized window), against the ~70pp a per-surface
 *  cost would predict. It tracks total canvas AREA, which the window size
 *  fixes, so splitting a window ten ways divides the same pixels rather than
 *  multiplying them. Practical consequence: window size and display scaling
 *  are the variables that matter here, not how many terminals are on screen. */
/** GH #70: the bundled JetBrains Mono is a lazy @font-face; xterm's WebGL atlas
 *  keys glyphs per (char, fg, bg, ext) with no font in the key, so a glyph
 *  rasterized against the fallback stays wrong-height until the cell happens to
 *  re-rasterize (selection changes the bg, new key, correct glyph, which is why
 *  selecting text "fixed" it).
 *
 *  The previous gate polled `document.fonts` for the family, but check() and
 *  load() both report a family READY before it is registered in the FontFaceSet
 *  (check() returns true and load() resolves with zero faces for an unregistered
 *  family, reproduced on WKWebView). Since fontsource registers "JetBrains Mono"
 *  via async CSS @font-face, that vacuous window is the poison window on a cold
 *  spawn. So correctness now comes from loadTerminalRenderer holding the WebGL
 *  attach until `terminalFontReady` resolves: real FontFace handles we own and
 *  await (lib/terminalFontReady). The atlas is then built against the real face
 *  and never poisoned, so nothing is cleared under a live renderer (the
 *  disproven #70 path). This fn is the spawn-side gate: it waits the same
 *  promise, then RE-FITS so the PTY cols/rows match the real metrics.
 *
 *  Warm path (faces already loaded, the norm thanks to the boot warm-up in
 *  main.tsx): return immediately, zero cost. The re-fit is guarded against
 *  zero-geometry hosts (collapsed split, same reason the panes' ResizeObservers
 *  bail at 0x0) and the mid-spawn window where term.onResize isn't registered
 *  yet, which would silently desync PTY cols/rows (hence the ptyResize retry). */
