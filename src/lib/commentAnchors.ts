// Keep a queued review comment pinned to the code it was made on, not to the
// line number it happened to sit at.
//
// A comment is stored as a 1-based line range plus the quoted source (see
// store/reviewComments.ts). That is the right shape to SEND — an agent reads
// "src/foo.ts:12-40" and a snippet — but line numbers are the wrong thing to
// HOLD while a comment waits in the queue: in an editable buffer, typing three
// lines above a comment silently moves the code it points at, and the batch
// then tells the agent to look in the wrong place.
//
// So while an editor is open, the comment's real selection lives on as a pair
// of document offsets that get mapped through every change the doc takes. The
// stored lines + quote are re-derived from that anchor. These helpers are the
// whole of that arithmetic, kept free of CodeMirror view/state plumbing so they
// can be tested against plain documents.

 * the exact start of the first commented line is text typed ABOVE the comment,
 * so the comment slides down instead of swallowing it, and text appended right
 * after the last commented line stays outside it. Get this backwards (the
 * intuitive -1/1 pair, which is right for a text SELECTION being extended) and
 * a comment on line 1 grows to cover every line inserted above it, which is
 * exactly the bug this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * Edits strictly inside the range still grow it, and whole-line expansion in
 * `quoteForAnchor` means edge-adjacent typing still shows up in the quote. A
 * change that deletes the range collapses it to a single position (callers
 * decide what an emptied comment means).
