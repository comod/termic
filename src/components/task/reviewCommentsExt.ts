// CodeMirror extension that turns a (read-only) diff/file view into a
// PR-style review surface (GH issue #28): select lines → "Add comment",
// type feedback, and it's held in the reviewComments store until the user
// sends the whole batch to an agent. Committed comments render as cards
// pinned under their range; commented lines get a left accent stripe.
//
// This is framework-free DOM (CodeMirror widgets aren't React). It talks to
// the Zustand store directly for persistence, and pushes store changes back
// into the editor via a StateEffect so cards stay in sync when a comment is
// deleted from the pending-comments bar elsewhere.
//
// Only mounted on the MODIFIED side (unified editor, or the `b` pane of a
// side-by-side MergeView) so line numbers and quotes always refer to the
// new file — which is what an agent needs to act.
