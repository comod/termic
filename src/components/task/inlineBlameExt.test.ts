// Cursor-line inline blame. Three things here are worth pinning, and they are
// the three that would silently produce a WRONG author rather than a visible
// break:
//
//  1. Annotation follows the cursor and only the cursor. A regression to
//     every-line is a performance regression, not a cosmetic one (see the
//     header comment in inlineBlameExt.ts on height-relevant decorations).
//  2. A line that was edited since the snapshot must NOT keep the old
//     commit's name. `MapMode.TrackBefore` is what drops the mark on a line
//     join, and the default `TrackDel` would slide it into the merged line and
//     confidently attribute someone else's code.
//  3. One git fork per file, cursor moves are memory lookups. That is the
//     whole reason VS Code's version feels instant.
