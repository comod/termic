// Inline git blame for the CURSOR'S LINE ONLY, as dimmed text after the code.
// VS Code's `git.blame.editorDecoration.enabled`, ported to CodeMirror 6.
//
// ── Why cursor-line-only, and not a blame column ──────────────────────────
// A per-line annotation on every line is the expensive shape, and CodeMirror
// makes that concrete. From `EditorView.decorations`: decoration sets given as
// a FUNCTION are computed after the viewport, so they may not introduce block
// widgets; sets given DIRECTLY may affect layout but cannot read the viewport.
// So an every-line blame column is either viewport-scoped and inline (rebuilt
// on every scroll) or directly-provided and height-relevant on all 15k lines.
// One widget on one line is neither: `estimatedHeight` -1 and `lineBreaks` 0
// keep it out of the height map entirely (view's `heightRelevant` getter), so
// moving the cursor never dirties layout.
//
// ── Where this deliberately diverges from VS Code ─────────────────────────
// VS Code blames at a SHA (`git blame --root --incremental <sha>`), which makes
// its cache entry immutable and never invalidated by an edit; it then maps the
// cursor's line back through the editor's quick-diff and prints "Not Committed
// Yet" for lines inside a working-tree change (extensions/git/src/blame.ts).
// That needs a live quick-diff model per editor, which termic does not have.
//
// We blame the WORKING TREE instead, so git itself attributes uncommitted
// lines (the all-zero sha) and the line numbers already match the file on
// disk. The cost is that the cache is invalidated by writes rather than being
// immutable, hence `invalidateBlame` on save / external reload / commit.
//
// For the window where the buffer is dirty and disk is stale, the snapshot's
// line starts ride along as a mapped RangeSet: `MapMode.TrackBefore` drops a
// mark when the newline before it is deleted, which is exactly "this line
// stopped existing". A line with no surviving mark reads "Not committed yet",
// same words VS Code uses, arrived at without a diff engine.
