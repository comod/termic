# Data model

## Directories

Three directories, different owners:
- `~/Library/Application Support/termic/` — app-owned: `projects.json`, `tasks/`, `scratch/`, `settings.json`. Path via `dirs::data_local_dir().join("termic")` in `lib.rs#data_dir()`.
- `~/Library/Application Support/com.simion.termic/` — tauri-plugin-window-state owned (window position/size). Path from `tauri.conf.json#identifier`.
- `~/.config/termic/themes/` — user-owned, hand-authored custom theme files ([docs/themes.md](themes.md)). `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` respected; shared by release + dev builds (no `termic_dev` split). Path via `lib.rs#themes_dir_path()`.

## Entities

- **Project** (`projects.json`, single JSON array) — git repo path + scripts + `preview_url` template + `preview_browser` (GH #245, an `Option<String>` **on purpose**: absent = follow the global `Settings.preview_browser`, `Some("")` = force the OS default for this project even when the global names a browser, `Some(cmd)` = override. A plain `String` cannot express that middle state, since empty is already spoken for by "inherit" — which is why `tasks_path`, the other project override, gets away with being one. Personal, never `.termic.yaml`: a launch command is machine-specific, so a committed `open -a "Google Chrome"` would be a silently dead link for a teammate on Linux, whereas a `preview_url` is portable) + `files_to_copy` globs + `default_cli` + `extra_named_ports` (personal env-var-name list for GH #196, unioned with the repo's committed `.termic.yaml` `extra_named_ports`; yaml order first, deduped, invalid/reserved names dropped — see `effective_extra_named_ports`) + optional `group` label (UI-only collapsible folder in the sidebar; no filesystem effect; a group exists iff ≥1 project carries the label. All group reads go through `groupOf()` in `src/lib/projectGroups.ts`, THE normalization point: trim + ALL-CAPS, so mixed-case labels on disk converge to one group. Collapse state + folder color live in `localStorage` keyed by normalized name, pruned when a group disappears).
- **Task** (`tasks/<uuid>.json`) — git worktree branched from project's `base_branch`. Worktrees live at `~/termic/tasks/<project>/<name>/` by default (configurable per project and globally). `is_main_checkout=true` tasks point at the project's live checkout (no worktree, archive skips `rm -rf`). Optional `order` holds the sidebar position within the project, written by drag-to-reorder (`task_reorder`). Projects get their order from the `projects.json` array; tasks are a file each, so they need the explicit key. `load_tasks` sorts on `(order, created)` with a missing `order` LAST, which is why a project nobody has dragged still reads oldest-first and a new task appends at the bottom of a reordered one. Each task also owns a consecutive **port block** (GH #196), allocated at create by `allocate_task_ports`: `port` ($TERMIC_PORT) + one port per composition member (base+1+i) + `extra_named_ports` (frozen name→port pairs from the project's effective list, injected wherever TERMIC_PORT is set and expanded in the preview URL) + a 5-port buffer. The block length is stored on the task (`port_block_len`) at allocation; blocks first-fit from 18100 over non-archived tasks (archived blocks are reused; restoring re-homes a block another task claimed meanwhile). Every load-occupancy→allocate→persist sequence holds `PORT_ALLOC_LOCK`, so concurrent creates / restores / top-ups can't scan the same snapshot and claim the same ports. This replaced the old `18100 + task count` formula, which could collide with multi-repo member ports. Names added to the config LATER reach existing tasks lazily: every tab spawn / run-script launch calls `top_up_extra_ports`, which freezes missing names into the task's buffer slots, overflowing to the next free single port anywhere once the buffer is full (`task_port_intervals` counts those strays as occupied for all later allocations; a restore re-home re-compacts them into a fresh contiguous block). Frozen pairs never move; names removed from the config keep injecting. Pre-existing tasks deserialize with an empty pair list and pick names up the same way.
- **Settings** (`settings.json`) — `preview_browser` (GH #245: app-wide command template that opens preview URLs and terminal links; empty = OS default), `repos_dir`, `welcomed`, `agents[]` (claude/gemini/codex defaults + customs; each has `command`/`args`/`yolo_args`/`runtime_yolo_command`). Defaults seeded if `agents` is empty. `schema_version` gates one-time on-disk migrations.
- **Scratchpad** (`scratch/<task_id>/index.json` + `scratch/<task_id>/<pad_id>.txt`, GH #244) — an untitled buffer that survives a relaunch, scoped to ONE task. Stored here rather than in the worktree so it never appears in `git status`, in the agent's review diff, or in a commit. The index record (`id`, `title`, `syntax`, `order`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) exists because a pad has no filename to re-derive a title or syntax from, and one index read beats stat-ing N files on launch. Pads are NOT part of `persisted_tabs`, which is agent-tabs-only by construction; they restore from this index when their task is first entered.

  **Archiving a task leaves its pads alone.** Archiving is recoverable (the task stays in History, the branch stays in git) and notes about the work are exactly what someone wants back when they restore it. The only thing that deletes pads is `delete_task_file`, the hard delete behind History's "Empty archive" and project removal — pinned by `only_the_hard_delete_purges_scratchpads` in `lib.rs`.
- **Tab** (per task, in `useApp`) — `terminal` (PTY running a CLI), `edit` (CodeMirror), `diff` (vs HEAD), `dir` (folder listing), `scratch` (an untitled buffer, GH #244 — a distinct type rather than an `EditTab` with an empty `path`, so blame / review comments / the disk-watch banner / "locate in file tree" become compiler errors to answer rather than runtime surprises). PTYs die with the app.

## Migrations

The "Task" entity was called "Workspace" before, on disk and in code. A one-time
startup migration (`migrate_workspaces_to_tasks` in `lib.rs`, gated by
`settings.schema_version`) renames the metadata dir `workspaces/` → `tasks/` and
rewrites the `is_repo_root` field to `is_main_checkout` (serde `alias` still reads
the old name). It is **metadata-only**: it deliberately does NOT move worktree
directories or rewrite each task's `path`. CWD-resume agents (Claude Code's
`--continue`) resume the most recent session by working directory, so relocating a
worktree would silently orphan its history. Existing worktrees stay under
`~/termic/workspaces/…`; NEW worktrees are created under `~/termic/tasks/…`
(`default_worktrees_base()`), and the two roots coexist while the old one empties out
lazily as tasks are archived/recreated. The metadata rename is atomic (stage in
`tasks.tmp/`, then one `rename` into place), guarded by a `tasks-migration.lock`,
backs up to `backups/pre-tasks-<ts>/`, and prunes-on-corruption (an unparseable
record, or an active worktree whose dir was deleted externally, is dropped +
logged to `tasks-migration.log`, never carried forward). The JS half
(`src/lib/lsMigration.ts`) renames the persisted `localStorage` pref keys
(`workspaceExpandMode` → `taskExpandMode`, `collapsedWorkspaces` → `collapsedTasks`,
plus the two `newWorkspaceLast*` keys); everything else in `localStorage` is keyed
by task UUID, which never changes.
