# UI

## Conventions

- Colors are `@theme` CSS vars in `index.css`. Accent terracotta `#d97757`, dark surfaces `#0a0a0a`-`#181818`. Never hard-code hex outside `@theme`.
- Ink on a solid **status/accent fill** must come from that fill's own `-fg` token, never `text-white`. On a `--color-accent` fill (count badges, filled CTAs, review-comment buttons, editor search checkmark, toggle knobs on an accent track) use `--color-accent-fg`; on a `--color-ok` fill (the AgentsSection toggle tracks) use `--color-ok-fg`. Do not reuse one for the other: a theme may pair a light accent with a dark ok. The accent is not guaranteed dark (cobalt sky 1.9:1, matrix green 2.5:1, rosepine rose 1.7:1 against white), so light-accent themes override the token to a dark ink. `--color-accent-deep` stays dark in every theme, so white text on it is fine, which is why the `:hover` states that drop to accent-deep flip back to white.
- `CliIcon cli={...}` + `CLI_BRAND_COLOR[cli]` for claude/gemini/codex (orange/blue/green).
- Tooltips default `delay: 0`. Override per-call.
- `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for class composition.
- All `<input>` and `<textarea>` get `spellCheck={false}` + `autoCorrect="off"` + `autoCapitalize="off"` + `autoComplete="off"`. Developer tool — paths and commands are never English words.

## Settings layout

Left rail + one content pane (`components/settings/Settings.tsx`). Three bands, hairline-separated, then the per-project list:

1. **Opened by choice** (General, Appearance, Agents & Terminals)
2. **Set once** (Tasks, Notifications, Prompts, Shortcuts)
3. **The perimeter**, what the app is allowed to do (Sandbox, Termic CLI)
4. `PROJECTS`, the only band with a label, because it is a dynamic list needing an empty state

The bands are what the app looks like and runs, then how it behaves while you work, then what it is allowed to do. Sandbox sits low because of the last one, not because it matters least. General leads by convention rather than by that rule: it is app-level and set-once, but every settings UI opens on General and fighting that expectation costs more than the inconsistency does.

Appearance carries its own sub-tabs (Terminal, Editor, Interface) on the strip Settings → Projects uses. Terminal leads. Its live preview is a real `AuxTerminal`, so it is click-armed: a settings visit must never fork a shell on its own, and the pty dies when the tab unmounts.

Each page owns one domain, and a setting belongs to the page whose domain it changes, not the page that happened to be open when it was written. General is app-level only (repos directory, personal file-tree excludes, remote images in the markdown preview); it is deliberately short. A new setting that needs a fifth thing on General is a sign the domain wants its own rail item.

Sections share `Controls.tsx`: `Toggle`, `ListField`, `Block` (hairline + spacing), `SectionTitle`, and `useBackendSettings()`. Use the hook rather than calling `settingsLoad`/`settingsSave` directly: it caches the whole `Settings` object and merges patches into it, so one page saving one field cannot wipe another page's. Prefs (`store/prefs`) persist on change; backend `Settings` fields either persist on change through `patch()` or use an explicit Save button when the field is a multi-line list.

Deep links (`openSettings(tab, repoId, highlight)`) hard-code a tab name, so moving a setting between pages means updating its callers. Live ones: the markdown-preview banner (`general` + `load-remote-images`), the command palette's settings list, and the shortcuts help dialog.

### Experimental features

A feature is Experimental when it is off by default **because we are not yet confident in it**, with a stated way out. Off for safety (remote images), off for taste (copy on select), and off as policy (sandbox permission bypass) are none of them experimental: those defaults are permanent, and labelling them experimental makes the label meaningless.

It shows as a badge, on the rail item and next to the page title, not as a separate Labs page. The badge is dropped when the feature graduates: it survived a release with no bug reports against it and has e2e coverage. Graduating drops the badge and gets a changelog line; it does not move the page, because a settings page that moves twice is worse than one labelled honestly. A dedicated Experimental page only earns its place when several features qualify at once, which today they do not (the CLI is the only resident).

## Window chrome / drag

macOS overlay title bar, hidden title, 84px reserved left for traffic lights. Three drag mechanisms (each fails differently):

1. `data-tauri-drag-region` — primary (Tauri 2 JS handler)
2. `WebkitAppRegion: "drag"` — backup (native AppKit hint)
3. `onMouseDown → startDragging()` — escape hatch (imperative)

Opt-out with both `data-tauri-drag-region="false"` and `WebkitAppRegion: "no-drag"`. mousedown handler skips `button, input, [data-no-drag]`. `startDragging()` silently fails without `core:window:allow-start-dragging` in capabilities. No `user-select: none` on drag region — put it on inner text spans.

## Dropping a path into a terminal

Two gestures, one landing point (`lib/terminalDrop.ts`): every terminal host registers itself with `registerTerminalDropTarget`, and a drop types the escaped path into that PTY through `ipc.ptyWrite` — indistinguishable from typing it.

- **From Finder** — Tauri's native `onDragDropEvent` (the DOM `drop` never fires, and WKWebView would not expose the real path anyway). Absolute paths, physical-pixel drop point. A drop on a **sandboxed** agent asks first: stage into TMPDIR, or allow the file/folder (needs an agent restart).
- **From the file tree** (GH #136) — a pointer drag (`startPathDrag`), same as the tab strip: **never HTML5 DnD**, which is unreliable in WKWebView and gets intercepted by Tauri's file-drop. Inserts the path relative to the task root (falls back to absolute for another task's terminal); no sandbox prompt, since the worktree is already granted.

Both share the hit test and the `.termic-drop-target` highlight, so they agree on where a drop lands.

## Close vs Quit (windowless mode)

Standard macOS app semantics, added as a prerequisite for the CLI's windowless daemon mode:

- **Close** (red button; ⌘W is "close active tab", not the window) → routed by the `close_action` setting. `CloseRequested` is ALWAYS prevented first, then Rust decides:
  - unset / `"ask"` (default) → emits `termic://close-requested`; `CloseDialog` asks **Keep in Menu Bar** / **Quit Termic**, with "Don't ask again" writing the choice back to `close_action`.
  - `"menubar"` → straight to windowless, agents keep running.
  - `"quit"` → teardown.

  Anything unrecognised falls back to **ask**, never to quit (`close_action_from`, unit-tested): a corrupt or hand-edited settings file must not be able to start killing agents.

  Settings › General exposes all three as a select. It has to include "Ask me each time", because ticking "Don't ask again" in the prompt is otherwise a one-way door.

  `CloseDialog` is deliberately NOT built on `ConfirmDialog`, which folds dismissal into cancel — whichever action sat on cancel would also fire on Escape. It has three outcomes instead, and **dismissal cancels the close entirely** (window stays as it was), so Esc can neither quit nor be the only route to quitting.
- **Quit** (⌘Q or the menu-bar item) → the only teardown path: `RunEvent::Exit` → `cleanup_children` SIGKILLs every PTY and script group.
- **Dock icon** click on a windowless app reopens it (`RunEvent::Reopen`). Unhandled before, but moot then: closing the window quit the app outright, so there was nothing to reopen.

This is a deliberate behavior CHANGE, not a bug fix. Previously closing the last window quit Termic and killed every running agent (tao destroys the window → Tauri fires `ExitRequested` → unprevented → exit). The teardown comment in `lib.rs` claimed the app survived a last-window close; that was wrong, verified empirically.
- **Menu-bar item** opens a menu on click (either button): **Show Termic** / separator / **Quit Termic**. No bare left-click "show" shortcut — that would leave Quit reachable only by right-click, which is undiscoverable for the one action that stops your agents. The separator keeps Quit off the muscle-memory path. It has no setting, deliberately. Its presence IS the signal "Termic is running without a window": shown when the window goes away, hidden on restore. A preference would only control whether it also sits there during a normal windowed session, which adds chrome and says nothing. `enter_windowless` refuses to drop the dock icon (`Accessory`) unless the item actually came up, so the app always has a way back.
- `termic`'s auto-launch passes `--headless`, which boots straight into windowless: no window, no dock icon. An instance that has never shown a window stays `ActivationPolicy::Accessory`; once the user has seen one, the dock icon persists for the process lifetime (Mail/Messages behavior).

The webview stays ALIVE while windowless — it owns PTY lifetime and every work-state signal, so tearing it down would kill the agents. It is not suspended (WebKit only clamps timers to 1 Hz). What windowless mode DOES have to do is collapse the task panes to zero geometry, or xterm keeps drawing for an invisible window: see docs/performance.md bear trap 2b and `src/lib/windowlessMode.ts`.

## Right-panel footer (Setup / Run / Terminal)

Three tabs. Setup + Run stream via `useScriptRuns`. Terminal is opt-in: click `+` → `useApp.enableFooterTerm(wsId)` → AuxTerminal mounts. RunToolbar: Open (expands `project.preview_url` with `$TERMIC_PORT`/`$CONDUCTOR_PORT`/`$PORT`/`$TERMIC_WORKSPACE_NAME`) + Run/Stop (SIGTERMs process group). Default: tab=Run, expanded.

`task_archive` sweeps `RUNNING_SCRIPTS` and SIGTERMs each before teardown.

## Settled detection / notifications

TerminalPane samples `term.buffer.active` every 3s, FNV-1a hashes the visible viewport, marks tab "settled" after 2 identical consecutive samples. Resets on user input. `markAttention(wsId, tabId, reason)` never marks the active tab in the active task. `useAttentionNotifier` suppresses OS notifications for every tab in the focused task. Desktop notifications off by default.
