# Fixture "agent CLI" for e2e runs (see .claude/skills/e2e + docs/e2e-tests.md).
# Registered in the scratch profile so tasks spawn / resume / queue against a
# real PTY with ZERO tokens.
#
# Built to behave like `claude` so termic's agent-state UI (working indicator,
# attention badge, notifications) is exercised realistically:
#   - long-lived interactive PTY: stays alive until signalled, like a TUI.
#   - drives the OSC terminal title with claude's status glyphs — `✳` when
#     idle (work done), a Braille spinner while working. termic classifies
#     these exactly as it classifies real claude (see BUILTIN_TITLE_SIGNALS
#     `claude` in src/lib/agents.ts). The `fakeagent` registry entry must carry
#     the same `capabilities.signals` for the classifier to fire (the e2e
#     profile seeds them — keep the two in lock-step).
#   - one busy -> idle cycle per submitted line, mirroring "type a prompt, it
#     works, it goes idle".
#   - echoes its argv so a test can assert resume flags (--session-id/--resume,
#     --name) reached the spawn.

# terminated: a stray BEL would trip termic's bell -> attention heuristic.

# Signal drills for the work-done specs. Real claude reaches states that a
# plain echo loop never does, so a line starting with `#` is a directive rather
# than a prompt:
#
#   #pending N  reproduce the backgrounded-subagent trap: print claude's
#               "Waiting for N background agents to finish" status line and go
#               to the IDLE glyph while the work is still outstanding. Every
#               byte-stream signal then says "finished" and only that line says
#               otherwise, which is the whole point.
#   #settle     clear the pending line (the work landed) and go idle for real.
#   #stage      a multi-stage turn whose FIRST stage looks finished: idle glyph,
#               quiet PTY, still screen, so termic calls the turn done. Then the
#               agent goes back to work long after that done and finishes for
#               real. Both halves have to survive: the spinner has to come back
#               (a done we got wrong must not outlive the evidence), and the
#               real completion still has to fire (the turn's done token was
#               spent on the wrong one). The sleep is long enough to clear
#               STICKY_DONE_MS counted from when the done actually fires, not
#               from when the stage ends.
