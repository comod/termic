// Steady-state RSS and RSS growth across repeated view churn.
//
// Why memory rather than CPU: this is the one metric of the four the roadmap
// names that a shared 3-core VM can say anything honest about. A leak shows up
// as a monotonic trend across iterations, not as a percentage, so neighbour
// noise moves the absolute number without destroying the delta. CPU on the
// same runner is dominated by noise we cannot see or control, which is why it
// stays in `make perf` and out of CI. See docs/research/perf-ci.md.
//
// The delta is the interesting row, not the absolute. Absolute RSS depends on
// the runner image; growth-per-iteration is a property of our code.
