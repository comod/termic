// numbers we want are OS-level and WKWebView exposes nothing equivalent
// (`performance.memory` is Chrome-only, and it would miss the helper processes
// where most of the cost lives anyway).
//
// ATTRIBUTION, inherited from the GH #140 harness: WebKit's XPC helpers are
// parented to launchd, not to the app, so ppid cannot attribute them. They are
// spawned moments after their host, so the host's helper is the lowest pid
// above the host's, taken per helper type. `helperCount` is recorded alongside
// the total so a wrong attribution is visible rather than silently folded into
// the series: it should be 3 (GPU, Networking, WebContent).
